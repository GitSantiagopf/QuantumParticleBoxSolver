# Quantum Particle Box Solver
This repository hosts a Python program that solves the Schrödinger equation for a particle confined within an infinite potential well. The Schrödinger equation is a fundamental component in quantum mechanics, describing the behavior of subatomic particles.

The code implements numerical methods to solve the Schrödinger equation for a particle confined in a region bounded by infinite potential walls. Key features of this program include:

Schrödinger Equation Implementation: Utilizes the differential equation of Schrödinger to compute the time evolution of the particle's wave function.

Visualization of Results: Provides graphical representations to display the resulting wave function and potentially other relevant properties of the solution.
